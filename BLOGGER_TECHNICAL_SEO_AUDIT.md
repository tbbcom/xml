# BLOGGER TECHNICAL SEO AUDIT

## Scope and evidence reviewed
- Primary requested path: `github.com/tbbcom/xml/audit-input/gsc/`
- Repository-mapped artifact found: `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/audit-input/gsc` (empty file, 0 bytes; no CSV/TXT/MD/JSON/image inside a `gsc/` directory)
- Available GSC evidence files reviewed from `origin/main` snapshot (these files are not present on the current working branch):
  - `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/audit-input/Chart.csv`
  - `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/audit-input/Critical issues.csv`
  - `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/audit-input/Non-critical issues.csv`
  - `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/audit-input/Metadata.csv`
- Evidence limitation: no URL-level export was provided for issue rows, so affected URL patterns are inferred and marked where confidence is low.

## Confirmed template-related behavior (not production XML changes yet)
1. **Robots noindex logic is active for search/archive/error pages**
   - XML trace: `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/xml/ilmualam.xml:28-32`
   - Effect: pages matching Blogger search/archive/error views are intentionally `noindex`.
2. **Canonical tag is implemented site-wide for non-feed views**
   - XML trace: `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/xml/ilmualam.xml:1305-1310`
   - Effect: canonical handling exists in template; duplicate clusters are unlikely due to missing canonical tag in standard rendered pages.
3. **Pagination rel next/prev is present**
   - XML trace: `/home/runner/work/xml/xml/asset/xml/ilmualam.xml:1332-1338`
   - Effect: pagination signals exist; does not itself prove indexing defects.

## Issue-by-issue findings

| GSC issue | Pages | Affected URL pattern (from available evidence) | Most likely cause category | Template section trace | Status |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| Alternate page with proper canonical tag | 645 | Likely alternate URL variants (commonly mobile `?m=1`, parameterized, or host/protocol variants), exact list not provided | **Blogger platform behavior + canonical handling + mobile `?m=1` URLs** | Canonical tag exists at `ilmualam.xml:1309` | Not a confirmed template defect |
| Duplicate without user-selected canonical | 156 | Duplicate URL clusters without explicit user-selected canonical at cluster level; exact URLs unavailable | **Insufficient evidence** (possible Blogger URL variants, redirects, or content-level duplicate paths) | Canonical exists at `ilmualam.xml:1309` | Not confirmed as template defect |
| Not found (404) | 121 | Unknown deleted/typo URLs; URL export missing | **Page content and/or redirects and/or external scripts** (cannot isolate) | No direct template-only root cause confirmed | Needs URL sample validation |
| Page with redirect | 75 | Redirecting URLs (likely http→https, blogspot↔custom domain, or legacy paths) | **Redirects + Blogger platform behavior** | No direct defect in template evidenced | Not a confirmed template defect |
| Excluded by `noindex` tag | 5 | Likely `/search`, archive, or error views (exact URLs missing) | **asset/xml/ilmualam.xml robots logic** (intentional) | `ilmualam.xml:28-32` | Confirmed behavior, expected |
| Crawled - currently not indexed | 83 | URL list not provided | **Google systems / page content quality / internal signals** | N/A | Not a template defect from current evidence |
| Redirect error | 0 | None reported | N/A | N/A | No active issue |
| Blocked by robots.txt | 0 | None reported | N/A | N/A | No active issue |
| Discovered - currently not indexed (Passed) | 20 | Resolved according to CSV | **GSC processing / Google systems** | N/A | Passed |

## Confirmed defects vs recommendations vs processing delays

### A) Confirmed defects (high confidence)
- **No confirmed production template defect** directly causing the major critical buckets from currently provided evidence.
- The only confirmed template-linked behavior is intentional noindex for search/archive/error pages (`ilmualam.xml:28-32`), which aligns with standard SEO handling.

### B) Recommendations (actionable next checks before any XML edits)
1. Export URL-level examples from GSC for:
   - `Alternate page with proper canonical tag`
   - `Duplicate without user-selected canonical`
   - `Not found (404)`
   - `Page with redirect`
2. Segment URL samples by pattern:
   - `?m=1`, query parameters, trailing slash, protocol, host (custom domain vs blogspot), label/search/archive, and deleted post slugs.
3. Validate canonical/redirect chains for sampled URLs:
   - final canonical target, status code chain length, and whether canonical points to indexable target.
4. Audit top internal sources of 404/redirect links in:
   - navigation widgets, custom HTML widgets, and old post content links.
5. Keep noindex policy for search/archive/error unless business requires indexing those pages.

### C) Likely GSC processing/system effects
- `Crawled - currently not indexed` and previously passed `Discovered - currently not indexed` are commonly Google indexing-state buckets, not deterministic template bugs.
- Trend data in `Chart.csv` shows indexed growth alongside not-indexed growth, which is consistent with crawling/indexing reclassification over time rather than a single template break.

## Proposed remediation plan (no production XML modifications in this task)
1. Obtain URL-level GSC exports for each unresolved issue bucket.
2. Classify each sample URL into one of: template, content, Blogger behavior, robots, sitemap, canonical, redirects, mobile `?m=1`, external scripts.
3. Produce a URL-pattern matrix with counts and confidence.
4. Only after confirmation, prepare minimal XML/content fixes for true defects.
5. Revalidate in GSC after fix deployment and monitor validation states.
